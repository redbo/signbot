This code was for my FavoTech LED sign, which has since perished.

It would display the current DOW, time, local weather, and top news items
scraped from around the web.  It was written back when I thought Twisted
might be a good idea.

protocol.py was assembled based on FavoTech's terrible documentation and
what I was able to glean by watching their Windows client talk to the sign
with Wireshark.
